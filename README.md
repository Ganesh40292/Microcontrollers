## 📌 About This Repository

This repository contains a collection of **Microcontroller Assembly Language Programs** developed as part of academic learning and experimentation.

Each program demonstrates fundamental concepts of microcontroller programming such as:

- Arithmetic operations  
- Logical operations  
- Looping structures  
- Data transfer  
- Bit manipulation  
- Input / Output handling  
- Delay generation  
- Interrupt handling (if applicable)

These programs are useful for:
🎓 Students  
👨‍💻 Beginners in Embedded Systems  
🛠 Anyone learning low-level programming  

---

Each `.asm` file represents an independent microcontroller program.
